        We like to think of Vincent van Gogh as a creature of the elements:
        buffeted by the wind and rain, or going mad in the sunflower fields
        under the wilting Proven√ßal sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here‚Äôs another, just as valid, idea of van Gogh: comfortable,
        middle-class Vincent in a top hat and coat, commuting to work in
        Victorian London, and spending his weekends rowing on the Thames, or
        strolling in Kensington Gardens.
